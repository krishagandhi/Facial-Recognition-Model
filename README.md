# Facial-Recognition-Model
•	The model was trained for 30 students, 140 images, who were assigned a unique id and predicted the result for the same.
•	It uses AlignDlib to align faces and EfficientNetB0 Architecture to aid with the model.
•	Model uses coco annotations to annotate the trained dataset and then match with the most positive result of the testing dataset.
